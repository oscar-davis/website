  This was a project during my second year of university, for a module about multimedia design. I made a 2D platform game about collecting coins to go on the London Underground. 
  
  I created the entire game engine from scratch in p5.js, using a grid based level system. I found jump mechanics particularly hard to achieve.
  
  There are some aspects of the game that I would change now, such as smoother player movement and better level design, but I have decided to leave it as is to serve as a progress marker in my coding journey, as this is what I achieved after about 1 year of coding, and I am proud of the result.
